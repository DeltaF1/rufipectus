Rust implementation of [Wren](https://wren.io/) ([github](https://github.com/wren-lang/wren))

Stupid pun:

## Goals

- Store primitive values alongside objects
- Learn about optimizing compilers
- Do as much compile-time type analysis as possible to reduce the amount of method lookups
- Add some more warnings and safeguards especially around null values
